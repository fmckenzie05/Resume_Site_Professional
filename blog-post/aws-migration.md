# AWS Migration Strategy: From On-Premise to Cloud-Native

*Published on December 10, 2024 | Category: CLOUD MIGRATION*

## The Migration Challenge

Our supply chain management system was hosted entirely on-premise with aging hardware, limited scalability, and increasing maintenance costs. The goal was clear: migrate to AWS while maintaining 99.9% uptime and improving system performance.

## Pre-Migration Assessment

### Current State Analysis
```bash
# Infrastructure inventory script
#!/bin/bash
echo "=== Current Infrastructure Audit ==="
echo "Servers: $(nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24 | grep -c "Nmap scan report")"
echo "Databases: $(ps aux | grep -c mysql)"
echo "Storage: $(df -h | grep -E "^/dev" | awk '{sum+=$2} END {print sum "GB"}')"
```

**Infrastructure Overview:**
- 12 physical servers (Windows Server 2012-2016)
- 3 SQL Server databases (2TB total)
- Legacy ERP application with 200+ concurrent users
- Critical uptime requirements (24/7 operations)

### Cost Analysis
- **Current annual costs**: $180,000 (hardware, power, cooling, maintenance)
- **Projected AWS costs**: $108,000 annually
- **Migration investment**: $45,000 (one-time)
- **ROI**: 18 months

## Migration Strategy: The 6 R's Framework

### 1. Rehost ("Lift and Shift")
**Target**: Non-critical applications  
**Timeline**: Weeks 1-2

```terraform
# EC2 instance configuration for rehosted applications
resource "aws_instance" "legacy_app" {
  ami           = "ami-0c02fb55956c7d316"
  instance_type = "t3.large"
  
  tags = {
    Name = "Legacy-ERP-Rehost"
    Environment = "Production"
  }
}
```

### 2. Replatform ("Lift, Tinker, and Shift")
**Target**: SQL Server databases  
**Service**: Amazon RDS

```sql
-- Database migration validation query
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    MAX(modified_date) as last_update,
    DB_NAME() as database_name
FROM inventory_master;
```

### 3. Refactor/Re-architect
**Target**: Core ERP application  
**Services**: Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- ✅ VPC setup and network configuration
- ✅ Identity and access management (IAM)
- ✅ Direct Connect establishment
- ✅ Backup and disaster recovery setup

### Phase 2: Data Migration (Weeks 3-4)
- ✅ Database migration using AWS DMS
- ✅ File system migration to EFS/S3
- ✅ Application data validation

### Phase 3: Application Migration (Weeks 5-8)
- ✅ Rehost legacy applications
- ✅ Replatform databases to RDS
- ✅ Load balancer and auto-scaling setup

### Phase 4: Optimization (Weeks 9-12)
- ✅ Performance tuning
- ✅ Cost optimization
- ✅ Security hardening
- ✅ Monitoring and alerting

## Technical Implementation Details

### Network Architecture
```
On-Premise ←→ [Direct Connect] ←→ AWS VPC
                                    ├── Public Subnet (ALB, NAT)
                                    ├── Private Subnet (EC2, RDS)
                                    └── Database Subnet (RDS)
```

### Database Migration Process
```python
# Python script for database migration validation
import boto3
import pymssql

def validate_migration():
    # Connect to source and target databases
    source_conn = pymssql.connect(server='on-prem-sql', database='supply_chain')
    target_conn = boto3.client('rds')
    
    # Compare record counts
    source_cursor = source_conn.cursor()
    source_cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM inventory")
    source_count = source_cursor.fetchone()[0]
    
    print(f"Source records: {source_count}")
    # Validation logic here...
```

### Monitoring and Alerting
```yaml
# CloudFormation template for monitoring
Resources:
  CPUAlarm:
    Type: AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm
    Properties:
      AlarmName: High-CPU-Usage
      MetricName: CPUUtilization
      Threshold: 80
      ComparisonOperator: GreaterThanThreshold
      EvaluationPeriods: 2
```

## Results and Achievements

### Performance Improvements
- **40%** faster application response times
- **99.95%** uptime achieved (exceeding SLA requirements)
- **60%** reduction in system maintenance windows

### Cost Optimization
- **$72,000** annual savings in infrastructure costs
- **80%** reduction in hardware refresh cycles
- **50%** decrease in IT operational overhead

### Scalability Benefits
- Auto-scaling handles traffic spikes (Black Friday, peak seasons)
- Database read replicas improved reporting performance by 300%
- Global expansion capability (multi-region deployment ready)

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Comprehensive Planning**: 6-week planning phase prevented major issues
2. **Staged Migration**: Minimized risk and allowed for rollback procedures
3. **Staff Training**: AWS certification program for team members
4. **Partner Support**: AWS Professional Services guidance was invaluable

### Challenges and Solutions

#### Challenge: Legacy Application Dependencies
**Problem**: Hardcoded IP addresses and file paths  
**Solution**: Used AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for configuration management

#### Challenge: Data Consistency During Migration
**Problem**: Ensuring real-time data sync  
**Solution**: AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) with ongoing replication

#### Challenge: User Acceptance
**Problem**: Resistance to new interfaces  
**Solution**: Maintained familiar UI through CloudFront and custom routing

## Security Enhancements

### Multi-Layered Security Approach
```json
{
  "security_layers": {
    "network": ["VPC", "Security Groups", "NACLs"],
    "application": ["WAF", "Shield", "Certificate Manager"],
    "data": ["KMS", "CloudTrail", "GuardDuty"],
    "identity": ["IAM", "SSO", "MFA"]
  }
}
```

### Compliance Achievements
- **SOC 2 Type II** compliance maintained
- **GDPR** compliance enhanced with data lifecycle policies
- **Industry standards** (ISO 27001) exceeded

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Reserved Instances Strategy
```bash
# Script to analyze RI opportunities
aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceType,State.Name]' --output table
```

**Savings Achieved:**
- **35%** savings through 3-year Reserved Instances
- **20%** additional savings with Spot Instances for development
- **15%** reduction through rightsizing recommendations

## Future Roadmap

### Planned Enhancements
1. **Serverless Migration**: Moving to Lambda and API Gateway
2. **AI/ML Integration**: Demand forecasting with SageMaker
3. **Multi-Region Setup**: Disaster recovery and global expansion
4. **Container Orchestration**: EKS for microservices architecture
